                  Established in 1938, the law school formed the nucleus of Arellano University. Named after the first Filipino Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Cayetano S. Arellano, the original school was located in historic Intramuros. In 1979, Arellano University turned over the management of the law school to the Arellano Law Foundation and in 1997, the agreement between Arellano University and the Arellano Law Foundation was amended to grant full fiscal autonomy to the Foundation.

                <p class="text-justify mb-4 font-medium text-md">
                  Arellano Law Foundation is a non-profit, non-stock organization established by alumni and faculty members of Arellano University for the purpose of contributing to the upgrading of the standards legal profession and to the efficient, fair, and honest administration of justice. Its major project in the attainment of this objective is the operation of the law school.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify mb-4 font-medium text-md">
                  The law school aims to create global lawyers, practitioners who are deeply educated in the law, practice-ready, and devoted to service not only in the local but also the international community. Under its new mission and vision, the school gives comprehensive and enlightened training to prepare its graduates for law practice and public services, and for law teaching and legal scholarship.

                <p class="text-justify mb-4 font-medium text-md">
                  The law school has always endeavored to be in step with the technological innovations and ease offered by the use of the Internet. In September 2000, we launched Lawphil.net, one of the Internet's top education references, serving the research needs of lawyers and law students, media practitioners, government offices, and foreign entities with an online law library at no cost. In January 2007 we partnered with the AsianLII (<a href="http://www.asianlii.org">www.asianlii.org</a>), a non-profit and free access website for legal information from 27 countries and territories in Asia. Soon the school will be subscribing to Westlaw, an online legal research service providing quick, easy access to a vast collection of US statutes, case law materials, public records and other legal resources, as well as current news articles and business information.

                  We have partnered with the Supreme Court e-Library to provide them with digital copies of Philippine laws. The law school's e-Law Center is also working on the Creative Commons-Philippine Project. Creative Commons is a non-profit organization that provides licenses offering a flexible range of protections and freedoms for authors, artist, and educators. These licenses are built upon the "all rights reserved" concept of traditional copyright to offer a voluntary "some rights reserved" approach.
